## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Notifier is event-consumer-only (no gRPC), uses RabbitMQ health check -- formalized in ARCH-03
- [Roadmap]: Auth service is the Clean/Hex reference implementation; replicate to others after validation
- [Roadmap]: Verification phase is last -- spin up infra in docker, start all services, verify via curl
- [Phase 01-contract-consolidation]: No caret on generate in build dependsOn -- same-package dependency pattern for Turbo
- [Phase 01-contract-consolidation]: Root script naming convention: generate:{package} for code generation commands

### Pending Todos

### Blockers/Concerns
