# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** Each service isolated with clear boundaries, single source of truth, and correct contracts -- reliable foundation for business logic
**Current focus:** Phase 22.1 — s3-core-encapsulation

## Current Position

Phase: 22.1 (s3-core-encapsulation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-09

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50% phase, [========================░░░░░░] 76% overall

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 44 (v1.0: 18, v2.0: 6, v3.0: 11)
- Average duration: ~2min
- Total execution time: --

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v3.0]: PersistenceModule is the reference pattern for all new infrastructure modules (forRootAsync, Symbol DI tokens, health indicator, shutdown)
- [v3.0]: No-magic-values skill enforced across codebase
- [v3.0]: 12-Factor compliance -- no env branching, no NODE_ENV reads
- [v4.0]: Config decomposition first -- modular sub-schemas unblock all infrastructure modules
- [v4.0]: Build order: Config -> CacheModule -> StorageModule -> gRPC -> HTTP+CB -> EventModule -> Shutdown -> Tracing
- [Phase 20]: Kept loadGlobalConfig() and default AppConfigModule for backward compat -- apps migrate in Plan 02
- [Phase 20]: Manual GlobalEnv type due to TopologySchema dynamic shape -- z.infer cannot resolve
- [Phase 20]: Added zod as direct dep to all 6 apps -- fixes TS2742 cross-package type resolution for per-service schemas
- [Phase 20]: Manual XxxEnv types with type assertions on loadConfig() -- same pattern as GlobalEnv for dynamic TopologySchema
- [Phase 21]: Export RedisHealthIndicator from cache barrel for downstream backward compatibility
- [Phase 22.1]: [Phase 22.1-01]: Foundation internal/external partition established; S3 storage primitives relocated to packages/foundation/src/internal/storage/; @Global() removed from S3CoreModule atomically with ReportsStorageModule explicit S3CoreModule import; temporary compat shim in storage/index.ts re-exports both new internal path and reports facade until Plan 02 barrel flip
- [Phase 22.1]: [Phase 22.1-02]: Foundation src/ reduced to {external/, internal/, index.ts}; top-level barrel is one line 'export * from ./external'; 22-line external aggregator mirrors original public surface 1:1; parser and notifier root modules no longer import S3CoreModule; Plan 04 BucketStorageModule compat shim and type-only StorageHealthIndicator re-export documented in external/storage/index.ts (Rule 3 auto-fix for StorageHealthIndicator type surfacing)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 22.1 inserted after Phase 22: s3-core-encapsulation (URGENT) — encapsulate S3CoreModule into per-service composition StorageModule, root modules see single storage module
- Phase 22.2 inserted after Phase 22: bucket-provisioning-automation (URGENT) — unified automatic bucket check-and-create mechanism driven by per-service bucket constants, works on MinIO (local/docker) and Garage (dev/prod) identically, integrated with health checks
- Phase 22.3 inserted after Phase 22: storage-smoke-test-endpoints (URGENT) — per-service HTTP debug endpoints for full CRUD cycle on each bound bucket (upload/download/delete/exists/getSignedUrl); cross-service reports bucket test (parser writes → notifier reads); gated by env flag for prod safety
