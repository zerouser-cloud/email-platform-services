# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** Each service isolated with clear boundaries, single source of truth, and correct contracts -- reliable foundation for business logic
**Current focus:** Phase 16 — ci-pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 17
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-04

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 24 (v1.0: 18, v2.0: 6)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 (1-8) | 18 | — | — |
| v2.0 (9-14) | 6 | — | — |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: all v2.0 single-plan phases
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 15 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 16 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v1.0]: Foundation Audit complete — 8 phases, 18 plans
- [v2.0]: PostgreSQL + Drizzle Migration complete — 6 phases, 6 plans
- [v3.0]: Docker Compose sufficient for current scale, no Kubernetes
- [v3.0]: Infrastructure changes require explicit user approval (infrastructure-guard skill)
- [v3.0]: Must fix unauthorized POSTGRES_PORT change from v2.0 Phase 14
- [Phase 15]: CORS_STRICT boolean flag replaces NODE_ENV check in Zod CORS refine (12-Factor)
- [Phase 15]: Docker compose split: infra-only (self-contained) + full-stack (include directive)
- [Phase 16]: NODE_ENV removed from turbo.json globalEnv for 12-Factor compliance
- [Phase 16]: Pre-push hook (not pre-commit) for local validation before CI

### Pending Todos

- Revert POSTGRES_PORT variable to standard 5432 in docker-compose (Phase 15, DOCK-03)
- Phase 18 (Deployment) needs VPS details from user before planning

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 18 blocked on user providing VPS connection details (SSH host, user, key) and domain name
